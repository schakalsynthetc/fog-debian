# fog-debian ## /fog/debian root for proots ###

A basic debian rootfs derived from the one packaged with GNURoot version someting or other -- the one I've been using to start emu from on my devices. I'm pretty sure I've gotten plan9port to build on one of these, too.

Mainly here for cloning convenience at the moment.
