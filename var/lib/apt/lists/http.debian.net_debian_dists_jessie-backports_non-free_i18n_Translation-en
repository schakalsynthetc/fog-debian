Description-en: AMD XvBA (X-Video Bitstream Acceleration) backend for VA API
 X-Video Bitstream Acceleration (XvBA), designed by AMD for its (ATI) Radeon GPU
 and Fusion APU, is an arbitrary extension of the X video extension (Xv) for the
 X Window System on Linux operating-systems. XvBA API allows video programs to
 offload portions of the video decoding process to the GPU video-hardware.
 Currently, the portions designed to be offloaded by XvBA onto the GPU are
 motion compensation (MC) and inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT), and
 variable-length decoding (VLD) for MPEG-2, MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) and VC-1 encoded
 video.

Package: nvidia-legacy-340xx-kernel-source
Description-md5: 0d3a57fcd0cca21a46e3f79950b8ff69
Description-en: NVIDIA binary kernel module source (340xx legacy version)
 This package provides the source for the NVIDIA Xorg binary kernel module
 needed by nvidia-legacy-340xx-driver in a form suitable
 for use by module-assistant or kernel-package.
 .
 The NVIDIA binary drivers provide optimized hardware acceleration of
 OpenGL applications via a direct-rendering X Server for graphics cards
 using NVIDIA chip sets.  AGP, PCIe, SLI, TV-out and flat panel displays
 are also supported.
 .
 PLEASE read /usr/share/doc/nvidia-legacy-340xx-kernel-source/README.Debian.gz
 for building information.  If you want the kernel module to be automatically
 installed via DKMS, install nvidia-legacy-340xx-kernel-dkms instead.

Description-en: RDNAP grid correction files for PROJ.4
 Kadaster and Rijkswaterstaat CIV, working together under the name RDNAP,
 developed RDNAPTRANS™2008, the precise and official transformation
 between ETRS89 and the dutch national horizontal and vertical coordinate
 reference systems the Stelsel van de Rijksdriehoeksmeting (RD) and the
 Normaal Amsterdams Peil (NAP). A ‘simplified’ procedure has been
 developed which uses a NTv2-grid for the transformation between ETRS89
 and RD as well as a VDatum-grid for the transformation between ETRS89
 and NAP. This ‘simplified’ procedure has the following limitations:
 .
  1) The rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid can only give identical results to
     RDNAPTRANS™2008 within 1 millimeter at ground level onshore and at
     mean sea level offshore. The horizontal deviation is approximately
     1 millimeter per 50 meter height difference from ground level or mean
     sea level.
  2) An exception to 1) is the border of the RDNAPTRANS™2008 correction
     grid. Transformation results within cells of the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid
     that are intersected by the border of the RDNAPTRANS™2008 correction
     grid can result in deviations of up to 20 centimeter.
  3) The naptrans2008 VDatum-grid cannot be used to determine deflections
     of the vertical. For this the NLGEO2004 geoid model has to be used.
  4) The naptrans2008 VDatum-grid is referenced to the Bessel-1841 ellipsoid
     and cannot be used stand-alone, it has to be used in combination with
     the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid.
 .
 Taking into account the limitations listed above, the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid
 and naptrans2008 VDatum-grid can be used as an alternative to
 RDNAPTRANS™2008 to transform geographic ETRS89-coordinates to
 projected RD-coordinates with grid correction applied and NAP-heights.
 .
 Note that, although the resulting RD/NAP and ETRS89 coordinates from the
 transformation will be correct, geographic Bessel-1841 coordinates will
 differ in both procedures and should only be considered as an intermediate
 result.

Package: tinyows
Description-md5: 4c02eed7a3bd0778ad0ca5cccb4fa0cb
Description-en: lightweight and fast WFS-T server
 TinyOWS is a lightweight and fast implementation of the OGC WFS-T
 specification. Web Feature Service (WFS) allows querying and retrieval
 of features. The transactional profile (WFS-T) allows inserting, updating
 or deleting such features.
 .
 From a technical point of view WFS-T is a Web Service API in front
 of a spatial database. TinyOWS is deeply tied to PostgreSQL/PostGIS
 because of this.
 .
 TinyOWS implements strictly OGC standards and pass successfully all
 WFS OGC CITE tests (and even beta ones).
 .
 TinyOWS is part of MapServer Suite, but provided as a distinct module
 (i.e you could use it in conjunction with MapServer and MapCache, or
 as a standalone app). But both MapServer and TinyOWS could use the same
 configuration file, if you want to (or native TinyOWS XML config file).

Package: varscan

Description-en: variant detection in next-generation sequencing data
 Variant detection in massively parallel sequencing. For one sample,
 calls SNPs, indels, and consensus genotypes. For tumor-normal pairs,
 further classifies each variant as Germline, Somatic, or LOH, and also
 detects somatic copy number changes.

Package: virtualbox-guest-additions-iso
Description-md5: 11a9eaac064138ec238f7c2ee4c018df
Description-en: guest additions iso image for VirtualBox
 VirtualBox is a free x86 virtualization solution allowing a wide range of
 x86 operating systems such as Windows, DOS, BSD or Linux to run on a
 Linux system.
 .
 This package provides an iso image which contains the guest additions
 for Linux, Solaris and Windows to be installed on the host system. The guest
 systems then can mount the iso and install the guest additions from there.
